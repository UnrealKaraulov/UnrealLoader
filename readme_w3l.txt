w3l - Warcraft III RoC/TFT 1.22a+ PvPGN loader (binary)
Legal note: 
This is not intended as a piracy tool! Make sure you have bought a copy of Warcraft III before using this loader. Even then you may be breaking the law. If in doubt, do without! 
This loader will not work for versions below 1.22a. Use the ACiD loader v1.2 for previous versions. It may work for versions higher than 1.27a but that is not guaranteed. 
Use at your own risk. 

Using: 
Place w3l.exe, w3lh.dll and wl27.dll into your Warcraft III directory. 
Run 'w3l.exe' when you want to connect to a PvPGN server. 
Run 'war3.exe' when you want to connect to battle.net. 
You can set delay value in file latency.txt. The proper delay value lies between 30 and 255. If wrong value is set or file is missed, delay value will be set to 100 ms. Default Blizzard's value is 250.

Notes: 
To play RoC when you have TFT expansion installed, run 'w3l.exe -classic' 
To play in windowed mode, run 'w3l.exe -window' 
If you connect to battle.net while running w3l.exe, you risk getting your cd-key banned.
